# Character-Text-Prediction

In this project, a character-level LSTM network for text prediction is mimiced. We further replace the LSTM part with Transformer. 
The result shows that Transformer can be used in the character-level prediction model, but it currently does not perform as well as the LSTM model, so it still has improvement space.
